										      <h2> Case I: </h2>
 16 yrs Hemophilia A boy, slipped and had trivial injury on his shoulder and head. 
His head injury went un-noticed by the patient but he had swelling in Right shoulder. 
He had high titre of inhibitor, that is the reason why he couldnot have specific treatment. 
None could recollect about head injury.He reported SUM Hospital at emergency in disorientation 
state( post 4 days of injury) and within 6 hours he started uttering repeated monosyllable and finally
had aphasia. The CT Scan of brain revealed brain hemorrhage ( intracranial bleed with Subdural hematoma). 
On emergency , neurosurgeon decided to reduce the mass effect on brain by decompression osteotomy 
with drainage. It was a challanging state to plan for operation in the absence of recombinant Factor VII. 
In the joint effort of STHM and company support, worth of 5 lakhs expenditure, the 1st operation was done in one sitting.
The parital scalp bone was removed and kept in abdominal fat for 2 months. After stabilization, again 2nd sitting 
of operation was done to replace back the scalp bone by removing from abdomen.

										      <h1> Stories of success :</h1>
										      <h2> Case II: </h2>
 A 13 yr hemophilia boy had long standing established fixed ankle deformity because
of repeated joint bleed since childhood. The treatment with factor concentrate could not be opted at right time, 
as he used to come from remote village. His gait became altered and gradually he was developing postural defect. 
He stopped going to school. With the help of physiotherapy and orthosis, his gait was apparently managed and progression of 
postural defect got halted. He rejoined school.
</li>

	<h1> Story of system failure and suffering :</h1>
										      <h2> Case III: </h2>
										    
14 yr hemophilia boy had an associated connective tissue disorder for which he had recurrent bleeding 
episodes in multiple joint, muscle and skin tissue. Bleed in subcutaneous tissue used to errupt the
skin and gradually heal with scarification. The best modality of treatment would have been prophylaxis 
to continue life long.  The mother learnt to infuse her son but still unable to support  because the system 
need to understand the basic requirement of the boy. They stay in remote village and to bring her son at least 
thrice or twice a week to the center for factor infusion is not possible. Now with growing age, the son is 
gradually detoriating. Her mother cannot carry to him to hospital in public transport and his father doesnot support. 	      
										      </li>
		<h1> Story of ignorance towards disease:</h2>
										        <li>
										      <h2> Case IV :   </h2>
	PWH (person with Hemophilia A ) of 23 yrs male, had hematoma in psoas muscle, which was reported as psoas abscess. 
	Surgery was planned without getting into work up for bleeding profile. On the OT table, the abdomen was opened 
to drain the abscess.  But the situation lend into intractable bleed. On emergency basis, the wound was packed with guaze 
and he was sent to tertiary care hospital for further management. He was diagnosed with FACTOR VIII deficiency. On past history, 
he used to have often bleed event in the knee which was considered as rheumatoid arthritis and was treated for pain management.
Now the approach was focussed on infusion of factor concentrate and was kept on ICU with nil orally for 15 days with the hope for 
conservative mode of healing.

The modality of treatment was changed with us. First the patient was counseled for reducing his apprehension and anxiety of fear 
of bleeding. Then he was made to take food orally. Under the coverage of factor concentrates, the VAC was applied and he was made 
mobile from the next day. It was applied for 5 days. The deep cut wound was closed from within and finally stitched. On twelth day, 
his stitch was opened and he got discharged on 14th day.
 </li>
 <li>
										      <h2> Case V :   </h2>
A PWH of 35 yrs old male, was diagnosed with knee tumor at a private nursing home and was opened up in surgery for removal 
of tumor mass under the coverage of plasma products. But the knee swelling was the common complication of chronic bleed 
sequence. The knee joint was opened and the hypertrophied synovium was taken out and finally was closed. (It was a case 
reported to us but we have reported as a lesson to educate community and health professionals.) 
										       </li>
										      <li>
										      <h2> Case VI :   </h2>
A 17 yrs PWH had a post traumatic non-healing ulcerated knee lesion and that was gradually worsening with increase in dimension. 
He was wandering from hospital to hospital during the COVID time for 2 months. Every time he was tested for COVID and kept on 
admission for factor infusion, antibiotics and half hearted dressing of the wound at the government hospital with factor supply. 
Basic mistake was with the non-availability of diagnostic support like inhibitor screening etc. The PWH reported to us, when he
was asked to go outside state for treatment. With proper dressing , a streamlined procedure of treatment with judicious use of 
factor concentrate, he got completely cured from non-healing ulcer of the knee within 14 days and was discharged from hospital. 
He was rehabilited further with physiotherapy.
										       </li>
										      <li>
										      <h2> Solution :   </h2>
 Factor concentrates are made available in many parts of the country. Hemophilia federation of  india, 
State Government and various hemophilia societies work for PWH to make India pain and disability free. 
Overall system will take time to reach the level of expectation in a vast country like india. But necessity 
of the PWH can make them to learn the facts faster. The mission of disability free india can only be successful 
with implementation of self infusion, home therapy and judicious use of factor. To educate PWH and those people 
who deal with this kind of disease need to understand the bleeding problem along with the social issues. 

Rather than providing excuses of no staff or withdrawl of health system to ignore these patients due to increased 
work burden, all district head quarter hospital should volunteer to procure factor concentrates ( provided by govt.) 
and enlist themselves as service providers for hemophilia, if a hemophilia patient is present in their district. 
	</li>									      
<li>
	 <h2> Conclusion :   </h2>
There are innumerable stories. The more we understand the disease and its complications, less mistake 
will be committed. Factor concentrates are very costly resource. Govt. sector and Hemophilia federation 
of India (HFI) through local hemophilia societies provide factor concentrates, free of cost through out 
the country. World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH)has remarkable contribution for PWH. It supports HFI 
with factor concentrates and has provided guidelines for management of PWH. Our responsibility is to 
follow them and make the best possible utilization of resources.

<li>   Large number of individuals from the rural setting had not heard about thalassemia, hemophilia and the cause
	of the disease is believed to depend on orthodox feelings like the sins committed by the parents. Further,
	>50% of individuals from the urban area were not willing for pre-marital screening for β thalassemia. Carrier 
	detection carries in itself the risk of social fear.This emphasizes the need for more intensive education and 
	awareness programmes in different parts of the country. The National Health Portal of the Ministry of Health and 
	Family Welfare, Govt. of India now provides information on thalassemia for the public and professionals. Yet, there 
	is no formal education on thalassemia in the curriculum for high school children. Intense education on thalassemia 
	from the secondary school level coupled with education of health professionals has been responsible for the success 
	of prevention programmes in the Mediterranean region. Mass media is a very powerful tool and it has been repeatedly 
	suggested that a short clip on β thalassemia by a leading film personality during prime time television programmes 
	shown over a period of time would have a significant impact on the population at large.

Many states like Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Karnatak, West Bengal, Assam, Gujurat etc run various projects for the treatment, 
management and prevention of these threatful diseases. There is National guidelines for hemoglobinopathies prevention and 
management but because of Patient overload in Odisha, it is difficult to pursue proper guidelines at government public health 
sector. Result is mismanagement of treatment and overall long term complications, which could have been prevented with proper 
formulated strategy.
		</p>
		<p>
 Majority fraction of the patient group belong to low and average socio-economic condition along with low education status and 
depend on government support for blood and medicines. Identification of carriers is important but screening should be voluntary,
where the participants make an informed choice and once they undergo screening, the next step to follow should be counseling. 
However, this is not always the case. Public health is looked after by individual states but under the National Health Mission, 
the Government of India provides financial support to the states. Due to lack of prevention programme there is log rise in patient 
population, as the concept of  genetic counseling, pre-marital screening and pre-natal diagnosis does not prevail. The foundation 
is led by medical professionals Dr. Hemlata Das along with team of physiotherapist, medical students and non- medicos, volunteers 
and parents of patients. 
			
	<!--It is a registered Trust act with Income Tax exemption under Section 80G and 35AC and has offices in different
districts of Odisha like Sundergarh, Balasore, Berhampur, Nayagarh, Puri, Jajpur, Sambalpur, Sundergarh, etc.. -->
<li>			
Hemlata Foundation is started by a group of like-minded medical and non-medical professionals (volunteers) committed to increase 
the awareness about the diseases and reach every common individual to participate in promotion of prevention.
			</li>
	</li>
	<li>
<!--The Government of India passed this act in 1994 to broaden the concept of organ donation and stop commercial dealings in organs, 
especially kidneys. It is now possible to not only donate one’s eyes, but also other vital organs like the heart, lungs, liver, 
pancreas and kidneys. -->
At individual basis Dr. Hemlata Das from IMS SUM Hospital, started the initiative with these three common genetic social health 
problems( Hemophilia , Thalassemia and sickle cell disease)and tried to formulate the network with student groups to pursue the 
message of prevention at different platforms.  
						</li>
						<li>
		<p>
 It is a big challenge for Hemlata Foundation to imbibe the concept of Hyper-transfusion for Thalassemia, where the concept prevails to transfuse blood when Hemoglobin is below 8 gm/dl. The guidelines say :
Transfusion Regimen: Pre-transfusion Hemoglobin (Hb) should be kept between 9- 10.5 g/dl.
