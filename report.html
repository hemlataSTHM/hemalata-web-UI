</p>
							<h2>Story of a winner:</h2> 
	<ul>
		<p>
			<li>
										      <h2> Case I: </h2>
 16 yrs Hemophilia A boy, slipped and had trivial injury on his shoulder and head. 
His head injury went un-noticed by the patient but he had swelling in Right shoulder. 
He had high titre of inhibitor, that is the reason why he couldnot have specific treatment. 
None could recollect about head injury.He reported SUM Hospital at emergency in disorientation 
state( post 4 days of injury) and within 6 hours he started uttering repeated monosyllable and finally
had aphasia. The CT Scan of brain revealed brain hemorrhage ( intracranial bleed with Subdural hematoma). 
On emergency , neurosurgeon decided to reduce the mass effect on brain by decompression osteotomy 
with drainage. It was a challanging state to plan for operation in the absence of recombinant Factor VII. 
In the joint effort of STHM and company support, worth of 5 lakhs expenditure, the 1st operation was done in one sitting.
The parital scalp bone was removed and kept in abdominal fat for 2 months. After stabilization, again 2nd sitting 
of operation was done to replace back the scalp bone by removing from abdomen.
										      
			</li>
										      
	<li>
										      <h2> Case II: </h2>
Stories of success : A 13 yr hemophilia boy had long standing established fixed ankle deformity because
of repeated joint bleed since childhood. The treatment with factor concentrate could not be opted at right time, 
as he used to come from remote village. His gait became altered and gradually he was developing postural defect. 
He stopped going to school. With the help of physiotherapy and orthosis, his gait was apparently managed and progression of 
postural defect got halted. He rejoined school.
</li>
										      <li>
	<h2> Story of system failure and suffering :</h2>
14 yr hemophilia boy had an additional connective tissue disorder for which he had recurrent bleeding 
episodes in multiple joint, muscle and skin tissue. Bleed in subcutaneous tissue used to errupt the
skin and gradually heal with scarification. The best modality of treatment would have been prophylaxis 
to continue life long.  The mother learnt to infuse her son but still unable to support  because the system 
need to understand the basic requirement of the boy. They stay in remote village and to bring her son at least 
thrice or twice a week to the center for factor infusion is not possible. Now with growing age, the son is 
gradually detoriating. Her mother cannot carry to him to hospital in public transport and his father doesnot support. 	      
										      </li>
		<h2> Story with ignorance towards disease:</h2>
										        <li>
	PWH (person with Hemophilia A ) of 23 yrs male, had hematoma in psoas muscle, 
	which was opined as psoas abscess. Surgery was planned without getting into work up 
	for bleeding profile. On the OT table, the abdomen was opened to drain the abscess. 
	But the situation lend up into intractable bleed. On emergency basis, the wound was packed 
	with guaze and sent to tertiary care hospital for further management. He was diagnosed with 
      FACTOR VIII deficiency. Again, the approach was focussed only infusion of factor concentrate but 
										      
	There are innumerable stories. The more we understand the disease and the  functioning system, 
	we need to work together for story of winners and successes.  
Factor concentrates are made available in many parts of the country. Hemophilia federation of  india, 
State Government and various hemophilia societies work for 
person with hemophilia to make India pain and disability free. Overall 
system will take time to reach the level of expectation . This can only be successful with 
urgent implementation of self infusion, home therapy till the system has not adequately developed. 
To educate PWH and those people who deal with this kind of disease need to understand the bleeding 
problem along with their social issues. Rather than providing excuses, all district head quarter hospital 
should volunteer to procure factor concentrates ( provided by govt.) and enlist themselves as service providers for hemophilia.
										      </li>

<p>
<li>   Large number of individuals from the rural setting had not heard about thalassemia, hemophilia and the cause
	of the disease is believed to depend on orthodox feelings like the sins committed by the parents. Further,
	>50% of individuals from the urban area were not willing for pre-marital screening for β thalassemia. Carrier 
	detection carries in itself the risk of social fear.This emphasizes the need for more intensive education and 
	awareness programmes in different parts of the country. The National Health Portal of the Ministry of Health and 
	Family Welfare, Govt. of India now provides information on thalassemia for the public and professionals. Yet, there 
	is no formal education on thalassemia in the curriculum for high school children. Intense education on thalassemia 
	from the secondary school level coupled with education of health professionals has been responsible for the success 
	of prevention programmes in the Mediterranean region. Mass media is a very powerful tool and it has been repeatedly 
	suggested that a short clip on β thalassemia by a leading film personality during prime time television programmes 
	shown over a period of time would have a significant impact on the population at large.

		<p>
Many states like Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Karnatak, West Bengal, Assam, Gujurat etc run various projects for the treatment, 
management and prevention of these threatful diseases. There is National guidelines for hemoglobinopathies prevention and 
management but because of Patient overload in Odisha, it is difficult to pursue proper guidelines at government public health 
sector. Result is mismanagement of treatment and overall long term complications, which could have been prevented with proper 
formulated strategy.
		</p>
		<p>
 Majority fraction of the patient group belong to low and average socio-economic condition along with low education status and 
depend on government support for blood and medicines. Identification of carriers is important but screening should be voluntary,
where the participants make an informed choice and once they undergo screening, the next step to follow should be counseling. 
However, this is not always the case. Public health is looked after by individual states but under the National Health Mission, 
the Government of India provides financial support to the states. Due to lack of prevention programme there is log rise in patient 
population, as the concept of  genetic counseling, pre-marital screening and pre-natal diagnosis does not prevail. The foundation 
is led by medical professionals Dr. Hemlata Das along with team of physiotherapist, medical students and non- medicos, volunteers 
and parents of patients. 
			
	<!--It is a registered Trust act with Income Tax exemption under Section 80G and 35AC and has offices in different
districts of Odisha like Sundergarh, Balasore, Berhampur, Nayagarh, Puri, Jajpur, Sambalpur, Sundergarh, etc.. -->
<li>			
Hemlata Foundation is started by a group of like-minded medical and non-medical professionals (volunteers) committed to increase 
the awareness about the diseases and reach every common individual to participate in promotion of prevention.
			</li>
	</li>
	<li>
<!--The Government of India passed this act in 1994 to broaden the concept of organ donation and stop commercial dealings in organs, 
especially kidneys. It is now possible to not only donate one’s eyes, but also other vital organs like the heart, lungs, liver, 
pancreas and kidneys. -->
At individual basis Dr. Hemlata Das from IMS SUM Hospital, started the initiative with these three common genetic social health 
problems( Hemophilia , Thalassemia and sickle cell disease)and tried to formulate the network with student groups to pursue the 
message of prevention at different platforms.  
						</li>
						<li>
		<p>
 It is a big challenge for Hemlata Foundation to imbibe the concept of Hyper-transfusion for Thalassemia, where the concept prevails to transfuse blood when Hemoglobin is below 8 gm/dl. The guidelines say :
Transfusion Regimen: Pre-transfusion Hemoglobin (Hb) should be kept between 9- 10.5 g/dl.
		</p>
						</li>
	</li>
	</p>	
								
								<li>To restore normalcy in the lives of patients with Thalassemia and Hemophilia regardless of their financial status by enabling access to improved care</li>
								<li>To sensitize public about the importance of voluntary blood donations.</li>
								<li>To boost the knowledge of “right time to act“,answer the ignorance by providing enough information about disease, management, cure and its preventions.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr/>
							<h2>Objectives</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>To aid the treatment and management of hemophilia and thalassemia.</li>
								<li>To impart and develop social awareness among people of Odisha by organizing awareness camps from time to time.</li>
								<li>To promote and encourage blood donation camps in Odisha.</li>
								<li>To organize lectures, discussions, seminars for dissemination of knowledge.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Goal</h2>
							<p>Healthy and productive thalassemics and disability free hemophilics.</p>
							<h2>Challenges</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Lack of awareness about hemophilia and thalassemia in the society</li>
								<li>Poor economic status of patients</li>
								<li>Lack of blood bank support for thalassemics</li>
								<li>Dearth of funds</li>
								<li>Huge bag between available resources and patients</li>
